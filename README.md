# Snappingbot-Commands
List of commands and what they do :) 



(the bot is not properly made yet so there might be some bugs for example sending a command to another chat or receiving a command from another chat. I apologise for any inconveniences, if you would like to remove the bot until the issues are fixed just type +leavebot)

Make sure to mod or vip the bot in your channel so it wont get limited

If you would like to have the pyramid command whisper me on twitch or twitter :)

## Info
---
IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS/IDEAS TYPE +suggest (suggestion) in any chat that has snappingbot - this will write  your username and suggestion onto a file which i will check regularly :) 

The bot is currently only online when my pc is on, I am saving up for a raspberry pi and will set it up within a few months. :) 

Apod changes at Midnight Eastern time (US East Coast). 

++ commands means that only the bot owner (turtoise) can use

## If you make the bot say anything against twitch TOS you will be put on the banlist and you will not be able to use this bot again.

## Special  thanks:

Nimmy0 - getting me started into learning how to code with python and the beginnings of the bot.

QuinnDT - being Yoda to us both  and helping me with some dank problems.

Matthewde - Massive help on v2 of the bot creating a proper irc parser that fixed a lot of issues v1 had.

without these people i wouldn't of got into creating a bot so they deserve some appreciation and acknowledgement <3
