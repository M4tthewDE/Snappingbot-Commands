IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS/IDEAS TYPE +suggest (suggestion) in any chat that has snappingbot - this will write  your username and suggestion onto a file which i will check regularly :) 

The bot is currently only online when my pc is on, I am saving up for a raspberry pi and will set it up within a few months. :) 

Apod changes at Midnight Eastern time (US East Coast). 

++ commands means that only the bot owner (turtoise) can use

If you make the bot say anything against twitch TOS you will be put on the banlist and you will not be able to use this bot again.
